# A Proposal on English Writing Reform - Grammar
We have already read the story of the other Tower of Babel, but the Americans are unaware thereof.

## Pronouns
### Thou, Ye, You
These are second-person pronouns in need of mutual distinction, which is shared among most Indo-European languages by first-language speakers. Pronouns *thou*, *ye*, and *you* are used where Germans uses *du*, *ihr* and *Sie*.

|Pronoun|Singular informal|Plural informal|Formal
|-|-|-|-
|Nominative|thou|ye|you
|Oblique|thee|you|you
|Genitive|thy|your|your
|Possessive|thine|yours|yours

Due to the variable accents scattered in world Englishes, the indifinite article _a_ becomes _an_ when followed by a vowel letter or _h_ before an unstressed vowel, and whence does _thy_ become _thine_. _e. g._,
- "An European" is attested at the beginning in [_Application of fresh mortar tests to poultices used for the desalination of historical masonry_](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1617/s11527-010-9695-4), from _Materials and Structures_ (fr. _Materiaux et Constructions_).
- ["An user"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/jeductechsoci.6.3.43), ["an utility"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2662838) and others can be found in correct English sentences by [Bing Dictionary](https://cn.bing.com/dict).
- "Night" by Elie Wiesel: "...Or was it really an hallucination?"

The only words beginning with vowel letters after _a_ or _thy_ rather than _an_ or _thine_ are _one_, _once_ and _oneth_, all exempted from orthographic reformation.

### A group of nearly homophonic examples
An [ewe](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ewe) (/ɪʊ̯/) is a female sheep. (Old English _eowu_)

A [yew](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yew) (/jɪʊ̯/) is an evergreen coniferous tree or bush of the genus Taxus. (Old English _īw_, _ēow_)

"[You](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/you)" (/ju:/) is the formal second-person pronoun in English, no matter one or many. (Old English _eow_).

## Verbs
### Do-support
In English, the use of the auxiliary verb do (or one of its inflected forms e.g. _does_, _did_), to form negated clauses and constructions which require subject–auxiliary inversion, such as questions, is used optionally as an auxiliary even in simple declarative sentences, usually as a means of adding emphasis (e.g. "I did shut the fridge."). This is nearly unseen in other European Union official languages.
However, in negated and inverted clauses, _do_ is usually used in today's Modern English, wherein the negating word _not_ is not attached directly to just any finite lexical verb; rather, it can only attach to an auxiliary or copular verb. For example, the sentence _I am not_ with the copula _be_ is fully idiomatic, but _I know not_ with the finite lexical verb _know_, while grammatical, is archaic. If there is no other auxiliary present when negation is required, the auxiliary do is used to produce a form like _I do not (don't) know_. The same applies in clauses requiring inversion, including most questions: inversion must involve the subject and an auxiliary verb, so it is not idiomatic to say _“Know you him?”_ but _“Do you know him?”_, though the former is accepted.

Why is do-support become idiomatic? Without do-support, the question

> What does that man eat?

—— can be written as ——

> What eats that man?

—— yet another question. Therefore, the do-support differentiate the latter question from the former, so it shall be mandated at most when:
1. Imperative "Do not" (even before the verb _to be_)
2. In Wh-questions, The subject contains not "I", "we", "thou", "ye", "he", "she", and "they" (only nominative forms differ from obliques other than "who"/"whom").
3. In Yes-no questions, The subject is not a single pronoun.

Otherwise, it is optional.

### Ending prepositions
End a sentence with preposition is a cummon way in Germanic languiges, but not Latin languiges.

## Numbers
### First, second, third, ...
But twenty-oneth, twenty-twoth, twenty-threeth...
One hundred and oneth, one hundred and twoth, one hundred and threeth...
We can also say "other" for "second".
