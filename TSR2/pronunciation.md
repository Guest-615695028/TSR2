# On a Concensus on English Pronuntiation
The English is well known for phonetic-spelling discordance among European languages, so that an IPA notation is Jennerally required for a dictionary to pronounce words (also common in overseas [French](/fr/README.md) dictionaries), which has been rising into concern of hundreds to thousands of millions of world English learners.

## Pronuntiation-Spelling Concordance
Stressed and only stressed vowel are to be marked on dictionaries, with full IPA givven to and only to irregularly pronounced words.

Jenneral Estuary accent is accepted midway between "Receeved Pronuntiation" of upper class and Cockney pronounciation of loër class, proposed upon comparability with Jenneral Amerrican and Jenneral Australian accents for being class-inspecific.

Notes:
1. Isaac Pitman's Ingglish Phonotypic Alphabet and Dezzeret runes (created 1847) suggested then-Jenneral American Pronuntiation.
2. /ɜː/ was reccognized as the allophone of /ʌ/ before /ɹ/ in the 19th century United States.
3. fore = foar (number 4) /foːɹ/ ≠ for /fɔɹ/
4. Short vowels are reccognized with singgle vowels. Unstressed vowel /æ/, /ɒ/, /ʌ/ allways becum /ə/, same as unstressed final A, /ɛ/ becumes /ɪ/ or /ə/.

The word _**receeved** pronuntiation_ implies that the British government has nevver been trying to subjectively define the standard pronuntiation of Ingglish in the United Kingdom or Inggland; though it is sumtimes referred as "the King/Queen's Ingglish", the Kings and Queens has never exercised their power to regulate English, as one thereamong, [George I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_I_of_Great_Britain) (28 May 1660 – 11 June 1727) lost all of his "reäl" powers due to incapability of speaking English, which is far from internashnality before Two World Wars in the 20th century. Also, the so-called "Receeved Pronuntiation" is only practiced in 3% of population in Inggland.

### `ough`
|Pronuntiation|Examples|Note
|-|-|-
|/ʌf/|Brough, chough, clough, enough, Hough, rough, slough (see below), sough, tough|Rhymes with _-uff_. Clough and sough are also pronounced /aʊ/.
|/ɒf/|cough, Gough, trough|Rhymes with _-off_. Trough is pronounced /trɔːθ/ (_troth_) by some speakers of American English, and a baker's _trough_ is also pronounced /troʊ/.[2]
|/aʊ/|bough, clough, doughty, drought, plough, slough (see below), Slough, sough|Rhymes with _cow_. _Clough_ and _sough_ are also pronounced /ʌf/. _Plough_ is Jennerally spelled _plow_ in American English.
|/oʊ/|brougham, dough, furlough, though|Rhymes with _no_, _toe_. Brougham is also pronounced /uː/.
|/ɔː/|bought, brought, fought, nought, ought, sought, thought, wrought|Rhymes with _caught_, _taught_.
|/uː/|brougham, slough (see below), through|Rhymes with _true_, _woo_. Brougham is also pronounced /oʊ/.
|/ə/|borough, Poughkeepsie, thorough, Willoughby|_Borough_ and _thorough_ are pronounced /oʊ/ in American English, thus rhyming with _-urrow_.
|/ʌp/, /əp/|hiccough|→ _hiccup_.
|/əf/|Greenough|/ˈɡrɛnəf/ as an Australian river, and /ˈɡriːnoʊ/ as a surname.
|/ɒk/|Clough, hough|Rhymes with -ock. _Hough_ → _hock_.
|/ɒx/|Brough, lough, turlough|Rhymes with loch. Many speakers substitute /k/ for /x/.

### Silent letters
Some proposed simplified spellings already exist as standard or variant spellings in old literature. In the 16th century, some Graeco-Latin literaturists tried to make English words look akin to their Graeco-Latin counterparts, at times even erroneously, by adding silent letters, so
- _det_ became _debt_,
- _dout_ became _doubt_,
- _sithe_ became _scythe_,
- _iland_ became _island_,
- _ake_ became _ache_, and so on.
However, We propose undoing these changes. Other examples of older spellings that are more phonetic include
- **_frend_** for _friend_ (acceptable, as on Shakespeare's grave),
- **_agenst_** for _against_ (again +‎ -st [excrescent]),
- **_yeeld_** for _yield_ (_cf._ Old English _ġieldan_),
- **_bild_** for _build_ (_cf._ Old English _byldan_),
- **_cort_** for _court_ (_cf._ French _cort_, Latin _cohort_),
- **_sted_** for _stead_ (_cf._ Old English _stede_, also _insted_),
- **_delite_** for _delight_ (_cf._ French _delite_),
- **_gost_** for _ghost_,
- **_harth_** for _hearth_,
- _rime_ for **_rhyme_** (_cf._ greek _ρυθμός_),
- _sum_ for **_some_**,
- **_tung_** for _tongue_, and many others.
Some of spellings are occasionally to be given in dictionaries for pronuntiation, as being far from words of their origins.
